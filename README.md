## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a game developer using Godot Engine and GDScript to create engaging and interactive 2D and 3D games. This repository showcases a collection of game prototypes, tools, and systems designed to demonstrate practical implementations of custom scripting, smooth animation workflows, and performance optimization for real-time gameplay.

Godotâ€™s open-source nature and lightweight architecture make it ideal for both indie projects and experimental game development. I leverage GDScript for its simplicity and tight integration with the engine, enabling rapid iteration and clean, readable code across all aspects of the game loop.

Scripting: At the heart of each project is robust GDScript logic that controls everything from player mechanics and enemy AI to UI behavior and scene transitions. I follow modular and reusable coding practices, making it easy to extend features or adapt them to new gameplay concepts.

Animation: This repository includes examples of both 2D and 3D animations using Godotâ€™s built-in AnimationPlayer, Skeleton2D/3D, and blend trees. Whether animating characters, UI transitions, or environmental effects, my focus is on smooth, expressive movement that enhances gameplay immersion.

Optimization: Performance is critical for maintaining fluid gameplay. I apply techniques like node and scene instancing, culling, physics tuning, and script profiling to reduce lag and improve responsiveness, especially on lower-end hardware or mobile devices.

This repository is intended for game developers, students, and hobbyists looking to dive deeper into Godot development. Each project includes source code, asset organization, and clear documentation to support learning and collaboration.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contributeâ€”game development thrives on creativity and community, and Iâ€™m always open to feedback and collaboration.
